# JSON Validation Service
The JSON Validation Service (JVS) is a validator that allows every users to check JSON objects for compliance with the JSON grammar according to [RFC 7159ยง9](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-9).

## Features

* [Plain API](#usage)
* [Easy to deploy](#deployment) using provided [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile)
* Supports configurable logging based on *Java Logging API* via [`logging.properties`](logging.properties) file

## <a name="usage"></a>Usage

### A Simple Way

```java
JSONValidationService service;

try {
    service = new JSONValidationService(); // use default parameters
    service.start();
} catch (JVSException e) {
    LOG.log(Level.SEVERE, "Service exception", e);
}
```

### Customize Options
You have several ways to build [`JVSOptions`](src/service/JVSOptions.java) and pass it to a [`JSONValidationService`](src/service/JSONValidationService.java) class constructor.
```java
/* to use default options */
JVSOptions options1 = new JVSOptions();
/* to populate parameters from the configuration file */
JVSOptions options2 = new JVSOptions("config.file");
/* manually build your JVSOptions instance */
JVSOptions options3 = new JVSOptionsBuilder("localhost", 8081)
                      .setPath("/app")
                      .build();
/* or tune parameters from the file at runtime */
JVSOptions optinos4 = new JVSOptions("config")
                      .newBuilder()
                      .setPort(8080)
                      .setDelay(32)
                      .build()

/* and use like this */
new JSONValidationService(option4);
```

## Configuration File

The setup configuration file is in JSON format with the following fields:
 * `host` - a hostname or an IP address for the server to bind
 * `port` - a port number that is used by the server</li>
 * `backlog` - the maximum number of incoming TCP connections</li>
 * `path` - the location of the service on the given server</li>
 * `delay` - the maximum time in seconds to wait until exchanges have finished</li>

See [jvs.properties](jvs.properties) file for an example.

## Handling the Responses

1. If received JSON is valid, it is formatted to human-readable form and sent back.

2. If data in a request is not conform to the JSON grammar, the following response is sent:

    ```json
     {
         "errorCode"  : 12,
         "errorMessage" : "plain language description of the problem",
         "errorPlace" : "the point where error has occurred",
         "resource"   : "filename taken from a URI",
         "request-id" : "the request id for easier tracking of errors"
     }
     ```

     Below is a list of known errors:

    | Code | Meaning                                                  |
    |------|----------------------------------------------------------|
    | 1    | Unterminated array                                       |
    | 2    | Unterminated object                                      |
    | 3    | Expected name                                            |
    | 4    | Expected ':'                                             |
    | 5    | Unexpected value                                         |
    | 6    | Expected value                                           |
    | 7    | Unterminated string                                      |
    | 8    | Unterminated comment                                     |
    | 9    | Malformed JSON                                           |
    | 10   | Unterminated escape sequence                             |
    | 11   | Invalid escape sequence                                  |
    | 12   | JSON forbids NaN and infinities                          |

Normally, JVS sends `HTTPS OK` responses with `Content-Type: application/json` in either cases.

## <a name="deployment"></a>Deployment

Run and build the Docker image:
```shell
$ cd "the path where the Dockerfile is placed"
$ docker build -t jvs .
$ docker run --rm -d -p 80:80 jvs
```

Or you can fork this project, change it as you want to, and commit the changes. Then you can simply run:

```shell
$ docker run --rm -d -p 80:80 jvs https://example.com/your_repo.git
```
